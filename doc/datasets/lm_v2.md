# Light Microscopy Datasets

The `LM generalist v2` model was trained on seven different light microscopy datasets with segmentation annotations for cells and nuclei:

1. [LIVECell](https://sartorius-research.github.io/LIVECell/): containing cell segmentation annotations for phase-contrast microscopy.
2. [DeepBacs](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBacs): containing segmentation annotations for bacteria in different label-free microscopy modalities.
3. [TissueNet](https://datasets.deepcell.org/): containing cell segmentation annotations in tissues imaged with fluorescence light microscopy.
4. [PlantSeg (Root)](https://osf.io/2rszy/): containing cell segmentation annotations in plant roots imaged with fluorescence lightsheet microscopy.
5. [NeurIPS CellSeg](): containg cell segmentation Segmentation of cells in phase-contrast, brightfield, DIC and fluorescence microscopy.
6. CTC (Cell Tracking Challenge): Segmentation of cells from the cell tracking challenge. TODO mark which datatasts we use.
7. TODO add DSB.
