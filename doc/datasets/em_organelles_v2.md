# Electron Microscopy Datasets

The `EM Organelle v2` model was trained on three different electron microscopy datasets with segmentation annotations for mitochondria and nuclei:

1. [MitoEM](https://mitoem.grand-challenge.org/): containing segmentation annotations for mitochondria in volume EM of human and rat cortex.
2. [MitoLab](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-11037/): containing segmentation annotations for mitochondria in different EM modalities.
3. [Platynereis (Nuclei)](https://zenodo.org/records/3675220): contining segmentation annotations for nuclei in a blockface EM volume of *P. dumerilii*.
