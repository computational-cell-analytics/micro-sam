# Examples

Examples for using the micro_sam annotation tools:
- `annotator_2d.py`: run the interactive 2d annotation tool
- `annotator_3d.py`: run the interactive 3d annotation tool
- `annotator_tracking.py`: run the interactive tracking annotation tool
- `image_series_annotator.py`: run the annotation tool for a series of images

TODO reference the notebooks as recommended examples for using the python library for things below

The folder `finetuning` contains example scripts that show how a Segment Anything model can be fine-tuned
on custom data with the `micro_sam.train` library, and how the finetuned models can then be used within the annotatin tools.

The folder `use_as_library` contains example scripts that show how `micro_sam` can be used as a python
library to apply Segment Anything to mult-dimensional data.
