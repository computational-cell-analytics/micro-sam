# Segment Anything for Microscopy

<a href="https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam"><img src="https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam/blob/master/doc/logo/logo_and_text.png" width="300" align="right">

Tools for segmentation and tracking in microscopy build on top of [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/).
Segment and track objects in microscopy images interactively with a few clicks!

We implement napari applications for:
- interactive 2d segmentation (Left: interactive cell segmentation)
- interactive 3d segmentation (Middle: interactive mitochondria segmentation in EM)
- interactive tracking of 2d image data (Right: interactive cell tracking)

If you run into any problems or have questions regarding our tool please open an issue on Github or reach out via [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/) using the tag `micro-sam` and tagging @constantinpape.


## Installation and Usage

Please check [the documentation](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/micro-sam/) for details on how to install and use `micro_sam`. You can also watch [the quickstart video](https://youtu.be/gcv0fa84mCc), [our virtual I2K workshop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxjU4W7bCis&list=PLdA9Vgd1gxTbvxmtk9CASftUOl_XItjDN&index=33) or [all video tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYZXQJ3f36GQPpKCrSbHjGiH39X4XjSO&si=qNbB8IFXqAX33r_Z).


## Contributing

We welcome new contributions!

If you are interested in contributing to micro-sam, please see the [contributing guide](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/micro-sam/micro_sam.html#contribution-guide).

## Related Projects

There are a few other napari plugins build around Segment Anything:
- https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-sam (2d and 3d support)
- https://github.com/royerlab/napari-segment-anything (only 2d support)
- https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-SAM4IS

Compared to these we support more applications (2d, 3d and tracking), and provide finetuning methods and finetuned models for microscopy data.
[WebKnossos](https://webknossos.org/) also offers integration of SegmentAnything for interactive segmentation.

We have also built follow-up work that is based on `micro_sam`:
- https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam - improves SAM for histopathology
- https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam - improves it for medical imaging
- https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/peft-sam - studies parameter efficient fine-tuning for SAM
