# Example Notebooks

We provide four example notebooks that demonstrate how the `micro_sam` python library can be used for:
- Automatic instance segmentation with minimal effort in the [`quick_start.ipynb`](./quick_start.ipynb) notebook.
- Automatic instance segmentation with more configuration options in the [`automatic_segmentation.ipynb`](./automatic_segmentation.ipynb) notebook.
- Applying a Segment Anything Model (SAM) to many images and evaluating the segmentation quality against ground-truth segmentations in [`inference_and_evaluation.ipynb`](./inference_and_evaluation.ipynb).
- Fine-tuning SAM on your custom data to obtain a better model for your segmentation tasks in [`sam_finetuning.ipynb`](./sam_finetuning.ipynb).

If you have an environment with `micro_sam` you can directly run these notebooks. You can also run them on [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code); we install the correct dependencies for it in each notebook.
