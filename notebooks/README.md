# Example Notebooks

We provide four example notebooks that demonstrate how the `micro_sam` python library can be used for:
- Quick start notebook for the featured automatic instance segmentation with `micro_sam` in [`quick_start.ipynb`](./quick_start.ipynb).
- Running automatic instance segmentation in [`automatic_segmentation.ipynb`](./automatic_segmentation.ipynb).
- Applying a Segment Anything Model (SAM) on many images and evaluating the segmentation quality against ground-truth segmentations in [`inference_and_evaluation.ipynb`](./inference_and_evaluation.ipynb).
- Fine-tuning SAM on your custom data to obtain a better model for your segmentation tasks in [`sam_finetuning.ipynb`](./sam_finetuning.ipynb).

If you have an environment with `micro_sam` you can directly run these notebooks. You can also run them on [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code); we install the correct dependencies for it in each notebook.
