# Example Notebooks

We provide three example notebooks that demonstrate how the `micro_sam` python library can be used for:
- Running automatic instance segmentation in `automatic_segmentation.ipynb`.
- Applying a Segment Anything Model (SAM) on many images and evaluating the segmentation quality against ground-truth segmentations in `inference_and_evaluation.ipynb`.
- Fine-tuning SAM on your custom data to obtain a better model for your segmentation tasks in `sam_finetuning.ipynb`.

If you have an environment with `micro_sam` you can directly run these notebooks. You can also run them on [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code); we install the correct dependencies for it in each notebook.
